🌾 SmartHarvest AI
SmartHarvest AI is an innovative agriculture-based platform designed to empower farmers and agricultural professionals through machine learning-driven insights. Our project aims to transform traditional farming practices by integrating powerful machine learning models that enhance decision-making and optimize resource utilization.

🚀 Machine Learning Models
SmartHarvest AI is powered by four robust Machine Learning models:

1. Crop Recommendation 🌽🌾
Assists farmers in selecting the most suitable crops by analyzing soil NPK values, weather conditions, and crop types, ensuring higher yields and better resource utilization.

Crop Recommendation Model
2. Fertilizer Prediction 🧪🌱
Provides precise recommendations on fertilizer use, helping farmers determine the exact type and amount of fertilizers required based on soil health and crop needs, promoting sustainable farming practices.
